# Parking Lot

We will focus on the following set of requirements while designing the parking lot:
1. The parking lot should have multiple floors where customers can park their cars.
2. The parking lot should have multiple entry and exit points.
3. Customers can have a parking ticket from the entry points and can pay the parking fee
   on their way out at the exit points.
4. Customers can pay the tickets at the automated exit panel or to the parking attendant.
5. Customers can pay either cash and through credit cards.
6. Customers should also be able to pay the parking fee at the customer’s info portal at
   each floor. When the customer has paid at the info portal, they don’t have to pay at
   the exit.
7. The system should not allow more vehicles than the maximum capacity of the parking
   lot. If the parking is full, the system should be able to show a message at the entrance
   panel and on the parking display board on the ground floor.
8. Each parking floor will have many parking slots. The system should support multiple
   types of parking slots like Compact, Large, Handicapped, Mototrbyke, etc.
9. The Parking lot will have some parking lots specified for electric cars. These parking
   lots can have an electric panel from where customers can pay and charge their
   vehicles.
10. The system should support parking for different types of vehicles like car, truck, van,
    motorbike, etc.
11. Each parking floor will have a display board showing a free parking slot for each slot type.
12. The system should support a per hour parking fee model. For example, customers have to pay $4 for the first hour, $3.5 for the second and third hours, and $2.5 for all the remaining hours.
