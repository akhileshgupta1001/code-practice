    //Problem Description
    //Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N. Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
    //You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.
    //
    //Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.
    //NOTE:
    //1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
    //2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.
    //
    //Return the ans % 10000003.
    //
    //
    //
    //Problem Constraints
    //1 <= A <= 1000
    //1 <= B <= 106
    //1 <= N <= 105
    //1 <= C[i] <= 106
    //
    //
    //
    //Input Format
    //The first argument given is the integer A.
    //The second argument given is the integer B.
    //The third argument given is the integer array C.
    //
    //
    //
    //Output Format
    //Return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board % 10000003.
    //
    //
    //
    //Example Input
    //Input 1:
    //
    // A = 2
    // B = 5
    // C = [1, 10]
    //Input 2:
    //
    // A = 10
    // B = 1
    // C = [1, 8, 11, 3]
    //
    //
    //Example Output
    //Output 1:
    //
    // 50
    //Output 2:
    //
    // 11
    //
    //
    //Example Explanation
    //Explanation 1:
    //
    // Possibility 1:- One painter paints both blocks, time taken = 55 units.
    // Possibility 2:- Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, time take = max(5, 50) = 50
    // There are no other distinct ways to paint boards.
    // ans = 50 % 10000003
    //Explanation 2:
    //
    // Each block is painted by a painter so, Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, painter 3 paints block 3
    // and painter 4 paints block 4, time taken = max(1, 8, 11, 3) = 11
    // ans = 11 % 10000003
